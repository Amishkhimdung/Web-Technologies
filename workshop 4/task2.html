<p>High On Life tells the story of a regular teenager who gets embroiled in a galactic conflict after an alien cartel discovers humans can be used as drugs. Of course, the only recourse is to become a bounty hunter and take the whole cartel down.
     A mixture of classic shooting, light RPG mechanics, and outrageous humor. From the Co-Creator of Rick & Morty and Solar Opposites, comes High On Life. Fresh out of high school with no job and no ambition, youâ€™ve really got nothing going for you until an alien cartel that wants to get high off humanity invades Earth. Now, you and a team of charismatic talking guns must answer the hero's call and become the deadliest intergalactic bounty hunter the cosmos has ever seen.</p>
